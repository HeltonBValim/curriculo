>>> Installation via package manager
You can use your operating system's package manager to install github-desktop and keep it up to date on Debian and RPM-based distributions.

Debian/Ubuntu
There are two APT package feeds available, both hosted in the US. You only need to add one or the other here, as both of these are generated based on the releases from this repository.

@shiftkey package feed
wget -qO - https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/shiftkey-packages.gpg > /dev/null
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/shiftkey-packages.gpg] https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/ubuntu/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/shiftkey-packages.list'
@mwt package feed
wget -qO - https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/gpgkey | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/mwt-desktop.gpg > /dev/null
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mwt-desktop.gpg] https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/deb/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mwt-desktop.list'

Other Distributions
Arch Linux
Arch Linux users can install GitHub Desktop from the AUR.

gnome-keyring is required and the daemon must be launched either at login or when the X server is started. Normally this is handled by a display manager, but in other cases following the instructions found on the Arch Wiki will fix the issue of not being able to save login credentials.

Cross-Distribution Packages
GitHub Desktop is also available cross-platform as a Flatpak and AppImage.

deb-get
Debian/Ubuntu users can also install directly from this repository using deb-get: deb-get install github-desktop.

Known issues
If you're having troubles with Desktop, please refer to the Known issues document for guidance and workarounds for common limitations.

If your package manager is still trying to reach PackageCloud, refer to the cleanup instructions for details about migrating away.

More information
Please check out the README on the upstream GitHub Desktop project and desktop.github.com for more product-oriented information about GitHub Desktop.
